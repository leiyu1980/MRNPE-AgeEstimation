# Caffe implementation of MRNPE 
Based on "[Multi-Region Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks for High-Accuracy Age Estimatios](https://www.dropbox.com/s/abk4r1pm65r4yzj/0911.pdf?dl=1)"

The sources will include:
1. Facial Landmark Tool
2. Training Files: train_net.prototxt, solver.prototxt, deploy.prototxt
3. Predicting File: predict.py
4. Caffe model (Website): Uploading on google driver
5. Pytorch version codes
